# Kinase-mediated Cardiovascular Toxicity

## Model Architecture

### Multi-Task Learning (MTL)

The framework employs a [multi-task learning](https://www.ruder.io/multi-task/) architecture with hard parameter sharing. It jointly predicts cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity by sharing early layers that extract general toxicity-related features. Each task has dedicated final layers for organ-specific predictions. This approach captures common patterns (e.g., class effects associated with EGFR inhibitors) while allowing specialization for individual organ toxicity.

### Self-Supervised Molecular Representations

We utilize a pre-trained molecular encoder, such as [MolCLR](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2102.10056), trained on large-scale, unlabeled chemical libraries like [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). This pre-training method leverages contrastive learning on molecular graphs to generate high-quality embeddings that encode important structural features. The encoder (Graph Neural Network or transformer-based model) is fine-tuned within the multi-task model to produce unified feature vectors.

### Transcriptomic Data Integration

To incorporate biological context, the model integrates transcriptomic features derived from databases such as [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or [LINCS L1000](https://clue.io/). These datasets provide gene expression profiles indicating how compounds influence biological pathways like inflammation or stress responses. The model employs a two-branch structure, combining molecular representations and transcriptomic embeddings into a shared, multimodal latent space that feeds into separate toxicity prediction layers for each organ system.

### Interpretability

The architecture includes interpretability features at multiple levels:
- **Attention mechanisms** in molecular encoders identify molecular substructures relevant to toxicity.
- Post-hoc methods like [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/) and contrastive explanations help pinpoint structural features critical for predictions. These insights can reveal known toxicophores or biologically significant pathway activations, enabling chemists to refine compounds to reduce toxicity.

## Data Pipeline

### Data Sources

The framework integrates diverse datasets covering chemical, biological, and clinical toxicity information:

- **Chemical Structure and Bioactivity:** Sourced from databases like [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) and [ToxCast](https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/exploring-toxcast-data), providing bioactivity metrics (IC50, Ki values) to predict target engagement and biological mechanism disruption.
- **Transcriptomic and Toxicogenomic Data:** Includes gene-expression profiles from [DrugMatrix](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/data/drugmatrix/), [Open TG-GATEs](https://toxico.nibiohn.go.jp/english/), [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), and [LINCS](https://clue.io/), which identify signatures correlated with toxicity across various tissues and conditions.
- **Clinical and Safety Data:** Labels for toxicity are derived from resources such as the FDAâ€™s [FAERS database](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/questions-and-answers-fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers), [ClinTox](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36966203/), and [Tox21](https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/assays/), which provide robust toxicity indicators across multiple endpoints.

### Feature Engineering

Compounds are represented by combining molecular graphs, biochemical descriptors (e.g., Morgan fingerprints), target activity profiles, and transcriptomic embeddings. These features are normalized and systematically integrated, with techniques such as PCA or autoencoders reducing dimensionality when necessary. Missing data are handled through imputation methods and dropout during training, enhancing model resilience to incomplete inputs.

## Training and Inference

### Training Workflow

1. **Encoder Pretraining:** Molecular encoders are pretrained on large chemical databases using contrastive methods like [MolCLR](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2102.10056) to capture generalizable chemical knowledge.
2. **Dataset Assembly:** Data from multiple sources are combined to generate labeled training samples, including chemical structure, transcriptomic data, and known toxicity outcomes for each task.
3. **Model Initialization:** A multi-task model is initialized with pretrained molecular encoders and transcriptomic data branches feeding into shared hidden layers, followed by task-specific output layers.
4. **Optimization:** The model employs binary cross-entropy loss for each toxicity prediction, combined into a weighted multi-task loss function. Optimization techniques, including dynamic loss weighting, ensure balanced performance across tasks.
5. **Regularization:** Early stopping, dropout, and hyperparameter optimization are applied using a validation set to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
6. **Interpretability:** SHAP values and attention maps highlight influential chemical features and biological pathways that underpin the toxicity predictions.

### Inference Pipeline

New compounds undergo the same feature extraction process before inference. The model outputs probabilities for organ-specific toxicities (cardiac, hepatic, neurological), which are calibrated for clinical interpretability. Thresholds determine categorical risk levels to guide decision-making during drug development.

### Evaluation & Benchmarking

Performance metrics include AUROC, AUPRC, accuracy, balanced accuracy, and calibration measures. Baseline comparisons involve single-task models, traditional QSAR models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost), and state-of-the-art published methods. The multi-task, multimodal model is expected to outperform these benchmarks by leveraging shared features and comprehensive data integration.

### Robustness & Generalization

Robustness is validated through:
- **Out-of-Distribution Testing:** Evaluating the model on chemically distinct compounds to ensure robust generalization.
- **Adversarial Testing:** Confirming the model reasonably predicts toxicity changes due to subtle structural variations.
- **Uncertainty Estimation:** Employing ensemble methods or Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence, allowing prioritization of uncertain predictions for further review.

### Ablation Studies

Component-wise analyses demonstrate the value of each model element (MTL, multimodal inputs, pretraining) by measuring performance degradation when components are removed. These studies establish that the combined approach yields significantly improved performance.

## Applications and Impact

This computational framework significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of early-stage toxicity screening in drug development. By integrating chemical and biological data, the model provides mechanistic insights and early toxicity predictions, aiding safer drug selection. Potential future directions include personalized toxicity predictions by incorporating patient-specific genomic and transcriptomic data, further expanding the clinical utility of this model.

Ultimately, the approach bridges cheminformatics and bioinformatics, providing a powerful, interpretable tool for pharmaceutical R&D, accelerating drug discovery while minimizing risk.

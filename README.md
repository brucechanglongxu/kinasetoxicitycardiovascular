# Model Architecture

**Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Design:** The framework uses a *hard parameter sharing* MTL neural network that learns **cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity** predictions jointly. All tasks share the early layers (capturing general toxicity features), and each task has its own output layer for organ-specific toxicity (three outputs) ([An Overview of Multi-Task Learning for Deep Learning](https://www.ruder.io/multi-task/#:~:text=Hard%20parameter%20sharing%20is%20the,specific%20output%20layers)). This design leverages shared representations to improve generalization, since related toxicity tasks provide complementary training signals ([An Overview of Multi-Task Learning for Deep Learning](https://www.ruder.io/multi-task/#:~:text=Hard%20parameter%20sharing%20is%20the,specific%20output%20layers)). In effect, the model can identify common patterns (e.g. class effects of EGFR inhibitors) while tailoring predictions to each organ.

**Self-Supervised Molecular Representation:** A powerful molecular encoder is pre-trained on large unlabeled chemical libraries (e.g. ChEMBL) using contrastive self-supervised learning. For example, one could adopt **MolCLR**, a GNN-based contrastive learning approach that augments molecular graphs and maximizes agreement between different augmented views of the same molecule ([[2102.10056] MolCLR: Molecular Contrastive Learning of Representations via Graph Neural Networks](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2102.10056#:~:text=present%20MolCLR%3A%20Molecular%20Contrastive%20Learning,can%20be%20transferred%20to%20multiple)). This pretraining yields rich latent representations of chemical structure that capture subtle structural features, improving downstream toxicity predictions. The pre-trained encoder (be it a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** or a SMILES-based transformer) is then fine-tuned within the MTL model, providing a unified molecular feature vector input to all tasks.

**Transcriptomic Feature Integration:** To capture *immune-driven pathways* and other biological context, the model integrates **transcriptomic data** as additional features. Drug-induced gene expression signatures (from public resources like GEO or LINCS L1000) are embedded and concatenated with the molecule’s latent vector. For instance, LINCS provides over 27k compound expression profiles across various cell lines, measured via ~1000 landmark genes ([
            Developments in toxicogenomics: understanding and predicting compound-induced toxicity from gene expression data - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6080592/#:~:text=2006%20https%3A%2F%2Fclue,io%2F%202017%20%28phase%202)). These gene-expression features inform the model about pathway perturbations each compound causes (e.g. upregulation of cytokines or stress-response genes), which often correlate with toxicity. By combining chemical and transcriptomic modalities, the model can learn associations between molecular structure, target engagement, and downstream biological effects (e.g. an EGFR inhibitor’s signature might include inflammatory chemokines). A **two-stream architecture** can be used: one branch (GNN/transformer) learns molecular features, while another branch (e.g. a feed-forward network or transformer encoder) processes transcriptomic features; the branches merge in shared layers that feed into the toxicity task outputs. This *multimodal* design provides a comprehensive representation, as demonstrated by recent work showing that combining molecular graphs with other descriptors improves multi-task toxicity prediction ([Multimodal Representation Learning via Graph Isomorphism Network for Toxicity Multitask Learning - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39432821/#:~:text=this%20issue%2C%20we%20propose%20a,toxicity%20classification%20and%20multiple%20compound)) ([Multimodal Representation Learning via Graph Isomorphism Network for Toxicity Multitask Learning - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39432821/#:~:text=we%20constructed%20a%20novel%20data,superior%20predictive%20capability%20and%20robustness)).

**Interpretability Mechanisms:** The framework incorporates interpretability at both the chemical and biological levels. *Attention mechanisms* in the molecular encoder (e.g. a graph attention network or attentive message passing) can highlight which atoms or substructures contribute most to a toxicity prediction. Post-hoc methods like **SHAP** or **contrastive explanations** are employed on the trained model to identify key features. For example, a contrastive explanation method can pinpoint *pertinent positive* substructures (toxicophores) whose presence drives toxicity, and *pertinent negatives* (substructures whose absence is notable) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10039880/#:~:text=prediction%20of%20in%20vitro%2C%20in,for%20a%20specific%20prediction)) ([
            Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PMC

This allows the model to highlight known toxicophores (e.g. an aniline group associated with hepatotoxicity) ([Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36966203/#:~:text=predictions,uncovers%20a%20preference%20in%20known)). Likewise, by examining the transcriptomic inputs via SHAP, the model can indicate which gene expression changes most influenced the prediction – often these map to biological pathways. The framework specifically looks for **immune-related pathways** in toxicity: for instance, it might show that an EGFR inhibitor’s predicted multi-organ toxicity is driven by upregulation of inflammatory cytokine pathways. (Notably, EGFR inhibition is known to disrupt skin barrier integrity and alter chemokine levels like **CCL2/CCL5/CXCL10**, leading to immune-cell infiltration and inflammation ([Frontiers | Mechanism of Lethal Skin Toxicities Induced by Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors and Related Treatment Strategies](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.804212/full#:~:text=leading%20to%20destruction%20of%20immune,%28113%29%20induced%20a)).) By linking such immune pathway activation to the toxicity prediction, the model provides mechanistic insight that is crucial for trust and hypothesis generation.

 ([An Overview of Multi-Task Learning for Deep Learning](https://www.ruder.io/multi-task/#:~:text=Hard%20parameter%20sharing%20is%20the,specific%20output%20layers)) ([An Overview of Multi-Task Learning for Deep Learning](https://www.ruder.io/multi-task/)) *Illustration of hard parameter sharing in the multi-task architecture.* The model learns **shared layers** from molecular and transcriptomic features that feed into task-specific output layers for cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. This lets the model capture common toxicity signals (e.g. class effects of EGFR inhibitors) while fine-tuning predictions to each organ system.

# Data Pipeline

**Data Sources:** The framework capitalizes on diverse publicly available datasets to cover chemical, biological, and clinical aspects of toxicity. Key data sources include: 

- **Chemical Structure & Bioactivity:** Large databases like **ChEMBL** (millions of compounds with bioactivity data) provide chemical structures and known target profiles. ChEMBL’s rich bioactivity data (IC50/Ki for various proteins) can be distilled into features (e.g. a vector of predicted target engagements per compound) to inform toxicity modeling. For example, knowing a compound strongly inhibits EGFR might signal class-related toxicities. Additionally, **ToxCast** by the US EPA contributes in vitro high-throughput screening data across hundreds of assays covering nuclear receptors, enzymes, and cellular stress pathways ([Exploring ToxCast Data | US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/exploring-toxcast-data#:~:text=The%20US%20EPA%20Toxicity%20Forecaster,the%20%2040%20CompTox%20Chemicals)). These can serve as *mechanistic descriptors* (each assay’s readout as a feature) indicating how the compound perturbs biological functions (mitochondrial activity, developmental pathways, etc.), which often links to organ-specific toxicity.

- **Transcriptomic and Toxicogenomic Data:** Public gene expression databases are used to extract toxicity-associated gene signatures. **Toxicogenomic** resources like **DrugMatrix** and **Open TG-GATEs** provide gene expression profiles in animals (e.g. rat liver, kidney, heart) after compound dosing, along with histopathology labels ([
            Developments in toxicogenomics: understanding and predicting compound-induced toxicity from gene expression data - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6080592/#:~:text=Progress%20in%20toxicity%20prediction%20will,in%20Table%201)) ([
            Developments in toxicogenomics: understanding and predicting compound-induced toxicity from gene expression data - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6080592/#:~:text=DrugMatrix50%20%20In%20vivo%20rat,blood%20chemistry%2C%20clinical%20chemistry%202015)). These help map which gene expression changes correlate with organ damage. Meanwhile, **GEO** and **LINCS L1000** offer human cell-line expression data for thousands of compounds ([
            Developments in toxicogenomics: understanding and predicting compound-induced toxicity from gene expression data - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6080592/#:~:text=2006%20https%3A%2F%2Fclue,io%2F%202017%20%28phase%202)). By mining these, one can derive features such as the activation of NRF2-mediated stress response genes or pro-inflammatory cytokine genes by a given compound – all potential indicators of toxicity. The pipeline can compress high-dimensional expression data into a lower-dimensional embedding (using PCA or an autoencoder) to use as model input. Alternatively, specific pathway scores (e.g. enrichment scores for oxidative stress or TNFα signaling) can be precomputed as features.

- **Clinical and Safety Databases:** For labeling compounds with toxicity outcomes, sources like **FAERS** (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) are invaluable. FAERS contains ~24 million post-market adverse event reports ([
            A Real-world Toxicity Atlas Shows that Adverse Events of Combination Therapies Commonly Result in Additive Interactions - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016889/#:~:text=given,market)), from which we can infer if a drug is associated with cardiotoxic, hepatotoxic, or neurotoxic events. A data-mining step identifies compounds with significant disproportional reporting of, say, cardiac AEs (arrhythmias, heart failure), hepatic AEs (liver injury, enzyme elevations), or neurological AEs (seizures, neuropathy). These signals form the binary labels for each toxicity task. Additionally, clinical trial outcome datasets such as **ClinTox** (e.g. whether a drug failed in trials due to toxicity) provide positive/negative labels for severe toxicity ([
            Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10039880/#:~:text=As%20a%20proof,The)). **Tox21** challenge data (12 in vitro toxicology assays) also supply labels for general toxic activity ([
            Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10039880/#:~:text=trials%20due%20to%20toxicity%2C%20as,5000%20mg%2Fkg%20as%20nontoxic)), which can be aligned with organ-specific endpoints (e.g. some Tox21 assays relate to neurotoxicity via neuronal receptor disruption).

**Feature Engineering & Preprocessing:** Each compound is represented by a **feature set** combining chemistry and biology. The chemical structure is input as a graph (atoms as nodes, bonds as edges) for the GNN/transformer encoder, and can also be featurized into classical descriptors (e.g. Morgan fingerprints, physicochemical properties) to augment learning. If available, a **target activity profile** is attached – a vector of predicted activities against a panel of protein targets (using QSAR models or docking, if experimental data is missing). This informs the model about likely on- or off-target interactions (for instance, a profile showing strong EGFR and HER2 inhibition might hint at class-specific toxicities). Transcriptomic features are matched to each compound; if multiple gene expression results exist (different doses or cell types), one can use the most sensitive scenario or average a subset, ensuring the feature reflects a toxicity-relevant response (e.g. use gene expression in hepatocytes for hepatotoxicity modeling). All features are normalized (e.g. RPKM gene expression values z-scaled, fingerprint bits binarized), and missing values are handled. **Missing data** is unavoidable: not every compound has transcriptomic data or complete ToxCast results. The pipeline addresses this by using default imputation (e.g. zeros for missing assay readouts, indicating no effect) and by designing the model to tolerate missing modalities. For example, a dropout or masking approach can be used during training to randomly blank out some inputs, training the model to be robust even if a feature set is absent. Dataset bias is mitigated by careful splitting – e.g. using scaffold splitting to ensure the test set contains novel chemotypes, and balancing the training set for positives and negatives in each task to avoid bias toward the majority class (which is often the non-toxic class).

**Data Integration:** Finally, the pipeline merges these heterogeneous data into training samples for the MTL model. Each training sample consists of a compound’s molecular graph/descriptor, its associated transcriptomic embedding (if any), and labels for each toxicity task. If a label is unknown (e.g. a compound never reported for neurotoxicity), that task is treated as missing for that sample – the model will simply not receive a loss for that task (effectively performing **partial label learning** in the MTL setting). The diverse data sources complement each other: chemical structure features allow generalization to new compounds, bioactivity/omics features provide mechanism-based signal, and the multi-task labels encapsulate outcomes. By training on this integrated dataset, the model can learn both direct structure-toxicity correlations and indirect relationships mediated by biological responses.

# Training & Inference

**Training Workflow:** Model training proceeds in several stages:

1. **Molecular Encoder Pretraining:** First, perform self-supervised pretraining of the molecular representation. Using a large unlabeled set of compounds (e.g. all ChEMBL or ZINC compounds), apply a method like MolCLR or a ChemBERTa SMILES-language model to learn an embedding function. This yields an initialized encoder that can map any compound’s structure to a latent vector that captures chemical features ([[2102.10056] MolCLR: Molecular Contrastive Learning of Representations via Graph Neural Networks](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2102.10056#:~:text=present%20MolCLR%3A%20Molecular%20Contrastive%20Learning,can%20be%20transferred%20to%20multiple)). Pretraining is unsupervised, leveraging contrastive loss (pairing augmented versions of the same molecule) or masked token prediction in a SMILES transformer, for example. The result is a chemical encoder with generalized knowledge of chemical space.

2. **Data Assembly:** Prepare the supervised training data for the three toxicity tasks. For each compound with known toxicity labels, retrieve its molecular graph (input to the GNN/transformer), and associated features (fingerprint, gene expression embedding, etc.) as engineered in the data pipeline. Construct the multi-task label vector: e.g. [cardiotoxic = 0/1/None, hepatotoxic = 0/1/None, neurotoxic = 0/1/None], where *None* indicates missing label (excluded from loss). 

3. **Multi-Task Model Initialization:** Initialize the MTL network. The pre-trained molecular encoder weights serve as the starting point (and will be fine-tuned). The transcriptomic branch (if any) can be initialized from scratch or using pre-trained gene embeddings (if available from an autoencoder trained on expression data). Shared hidden layers (fully-connected layers or transformer layers) are set up next, followed by three output heads (one per toxicity). Each head is a classifier (single neuron with sigmoid output for binary toxic/not toxic, or a small layer ending in sigmoid). The multi-task architecture will share most weights except these head-specific layers.

4. **Loss Function and Optimization:** During training, the model computes a prediction for each toxicity task. A **multi-task loss** is defined as the weighted sum of each task’s loss. For binary toxicity classification, binary cross-entropy (BCE) is used for each task. The framework may weight tasks to handle imbalance – e.g. if cardiotoxicity has fewer labels, one might up-weight its loss to ensure it learns adequately. An alternative is using **uncertainty-based weighting**, where the model dynamically weights each task’s loss inversely to its observed performance variance (an approach proposed in multi-task literature to balance learning). In practice, a simple equal weighting or proportional weighting to task sample size can work. The optimizer (e.g. Adam) iteratively updates model weights to minimize the multi-task loss. Importantly, when a training sample lacks a label for a task, the loss for that task is skipped for that sample (so the gradient only comes from the tasks with labels). This way, we can train on heterogeneous data where not every compound contributes to every task.

5. **Regularization and Validation:** Standard practices like early stopping and dropout are used to prevent overfitting. A portion of data is set aside as a *validation set* for model selection. Because this is multi-task, the selection criterion may be a composite metric – for instance, the average validation AUROC across the three tasks, or a weighted average favoring the most critical task. Hyperparameters (learning rate, number of GNN layers, size of shared layers, dropout rate, etc.) are tuned via grid search or Bayesian optimization, evaluating on the validation set. The architecture allows some task-specific tuning; e.g. one might find that adding an extra layer in the “cardio” head improves that task without harming others. The **multi-task nature** acts as a regularizer (shared layers reduce effective parameters per task ([An Overview of Multi-Task Learning for Deep Learning](https://www.ruder.io/multi-task/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Hard%20parameter%20sharing%20Figure,learning%20in%20deep%20neural%20networks))), but we also monitor each task to ensure none is underfitting or overfitting. If one task’s performance lags significantly, techniques like GradNorm (gradual loss weighting adjustment) could be employed to balance training.

6. **Model Interpretation (Post-training):** After training, we also run interpretability analyses on the model using the training data (or a hold-out set) to extract the learned knowledge. For example, we compute SHAP values for a set of compounds to see which input features strongly influence each toxicity output. We may observe, for instance, that for hepatotoxicity predictions, the presence of a *reactive metabolite substructure* and the induction of *oxidative stress genes* are key positive drivers – consistent with known mechanisms of liver injury.

**Inference Pipeline:** Once trained and validated, the model can predict toxicity risk for *new compounds*. The inference process is as follows:

1. **Input Processing:** For a query compound (e.g. a new drug candidate), we first generate its input features. The molecular structure (SMILES or mol file) is converted to the graph or token sequence required by the encoder. If the compound has known or predicted target activities, those are compiled (e.g. using a target prediction model or looking up similar compounds). If transcriptomic data is available – for instance, if the compound was tested in a gene expression assay or if we can obtain gene expression by treating a cultured cell – that vector is prepared. (In many cases for a novel compound, we might not have actual transcriptomic data; the model can still operate using only the chemical features. The design during training to handle missing modalities ensures robustness here. Optionally, one could *predict* a gene signature using a separate ML model trained on structure-to-expression mapping, but that is outside the main scope.)

2. **Model Prediction:** The compound’s features are fed through the trained MTL model. The shared layers produce a latent representation that is then routed to each task head. The model outputs three probability scores (between 0 and 1): e.g. P(cardiotoxicity), P(hepatotoxicity), P(neurotoxicity). These can be interpreted as the risk of significant toxicity in each organ system. For example, the model might output high risk for hepatic toxicity (say 0.8 probability) and low for the others – flagging the compound as likely hepatotoxic.

3. **Calibration and Thresholding:** The raw output scores are then calibrated to improve interpretability as needed. Calibration can be done via Platt scaling or isotonic regression on a validation set so that a score of 0.8 truly corresponds to an 80% chance of toxicity as observed historically ([Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36966203/#:~:text=Morgan%20fingerprints%20and%20pre,model%20and%20transfer%20learning%2C%20we)). Each task may have its own threshold for calling a compound “toxic.” For instance, if high sensitivity is desired, one might set a threshold so that, say, 90% of known toxic compounds score above it. The output could thus be presented as a categorical prediction (Toxic/Non-toxic) with a confidence level.

4. **Interpretation of Prediction:** An important part of inference is providing reasoning for the prediction – crucial for decision-making in drug development. The framework’s interpretability tools can be applied case-by-case. For a given compound input, we can visualize which atom clusters had high attention weights or contributed most to the model’s decision for each toxicity. Likewise, if transcriptomic data was input, we can list top genes that swung the prediction. For instance, the model might explain a high hepatotoxicity score by highlighting a nitro-aromatic substructure in the molecule and the strong induction of *CYP450 enzymes* and *inflammation genes* in its expression profile. Such an interpretable output enables chemists and toxicologists to understand *why* the compound is predicted to be toxic and consider remedial measures (e.g. modify the problematic substructure).

5. **Batch and High-Throughput Screening:** The pipeline supports running large libraries of compounds through the model efficiently. The GNN and neural nets are vectorized, so one can perform inference on thousands of compounds (possibly with just their SMILES as input) to prioritize which ones might have multi-organ toxicity. Because it’s multi-task, the model provides a *toxicity profile* across organs in one go, which is useful to identify, for example, that a series of EGFR inhibitors all show a consistent hepatotoxicity signal but varied neurotoxicity, guiding which analog might be safer.

Throughout inference, the model’s multi-task nature means it considers the latent factors that link organ toxicities. For a new EGFR inhibitor, even without explicit prior knowledge of toxicity, the shared representation (which may capture the EGFR-target class effect learned during training) could lead to elevated risk predictions in multiple organs simultaneously, reflecting the learned similarity to other EGFR inhibitors that caused multi-organ effects. This ability to generalize to novel but mechanistically similar compounds is a key advantage of the MTL approach.

# Evaluation & Benchmarking

**Performance Metrics:** We evaluate the model on a held-out test set of compounds with known toxicity outcomes, using several metrics to assess predictive performance and reliability. The primary metrics for each toxicity task are the **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC)** – measuring the ability to discriminate toxic vs non-toxic – and the **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)** – which is informative for imbalanced data where toxic compounds are relatively rare. High AUROC (close to 1.0) indicates the model ranks toxic compounds above non-toxics consistently. We also report **accuracy** and **balanced accuracy**, but these can be less informative if classes are imbalanced. Because we care about how well-calibrated the risk scores are (for making go/no-go decisions in drug development), we examine **calibration curves**: e.g. does ~20% of compounds that receive a 0.2 predicted risk actually turn out toxic? A **Brier score** or ECE (expected calibration error) can summarize calibration. Ideally, the model not only discriminates well but also provides probability estimates that reflect true risk frequencies ([Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36966203/#:~:text=Morgan%20fingerprints%20and%20pre,model%20and%20transfer%20learning%2C%20we)). For a more interpretable threshold-based assessment, we might choose a probability cutoff (say 0.5) for each task and compute **sensitivity, specificity,** and **precision** (positive predictive value). In a safety context, a common priority is high sensitivity (catch most toxic compounds, even if it means some false alarms), so we’d check the **recall** of known tox compounds at whatever threshold is chosen.

**Baseline Comparisons:** To demonstrate the value of the multi-task, multi-modal approach, we compare our framework against several baselines. One baseline is a **single-task model** for each toxicity endpoint trained in isolation (similar architecture but only one output). Typically, multi-task learning improves performance by leveraging shared features; we expect to see our MTL model outperform single-task models in AUROC or show superior learning especially for tasks with limited data ([Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36966203/#:~:text=Morgan%20fingerprints%20and%20pre,model%20and%20transfer%20learning%2C%20we)) ([Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36966203/#:~:text=predictions,To%20our)). We also compare to conventional **QSAR models**: e.g. a Random Forest or XGBoost classifier using Morgan fingerprints and phys-chem descriptors, trained separately for each toxicity. Such models capture simple structure-toxicity correlations. The deep learning model (especially with pretraining and transcriptomic features) should beat these baselines, which we would quantify – for instance, “MTL model achieved AUROC of 0.85 vs 0.75 for the best Random Forest QSAR on hepatotoxicity.” Another baseline could be published models: if available, e.g. the Tox21 challenge winners or other state-of-the-art toxicity predictors for those organs. In essence, we show that by **learning tasks together and integrating multi-domain data, we achieve equal or better performance** than specialized models for each task alone, confirming the advantage of multi-task deep learning ([Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36966203/#:~:text=Morgan%20fingerprints%20and%20pre,model%20and%20transfer%20learning%2C%20we)). 

**Robustness and Generalization:** We thoroughly evaluate the model’s robustness, as real-world applicability demands stable performance on novel compounds and in varied scenarios:

- **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization:** We test the model on compounds that differ from the training distribution. For example, we hold out an entire chemical scaffold or a new chemical series, or we test on a set of drugs from a different chemical space (e.g. natural products if training was on synthetic molecules). The model’s pretraining and graph-based learning should confer some ability to generalize to new chemotypes. We measure drop in performance on OOD subsets. If performance degrades, we analyze where – perhaps the model struggles if a compound’s features go beyond the range seen in training. We may also use **t-SNE** or PCA to ensure the latent space learned doesn’t cluster purely by scaffold, indicating it’s learning mechanism-related features instead ([Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36966203/#:~:text=predictions,To%20our)).

- **Adversarial/Stress Testing:** We purposely test scenarios like compounds with very subtle differences (activity cliffs) to see if the model predictions shift reasonably. For instance, if a single chlorine substitution is known to reduce toxicity experimentally, does the model correspondingly lower the predicted risk? Additionally, we check **confounding factors** – e.g. does the model wrongly correlate simple properties like molecular weight with toxicity (a potential bias if many toxic drugs are heavy)? We can do this by analyzing feature importance globally or testing on a contrived set where such correlations break.

- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Because predictions will inform critical decisions, we gauge the model’s confidence. We implement an uncertainty estimation technique, such as using an **ensemble of models** (train multiple MTL networks with different seeds or bootstrapped data) or **Monte Carlo dropout** at inference to get a distribution of outputs per compound. This yields a measure of prediction uncertainty (e.g. a wide variance among ensemble predictions means low confidence). We evaluate whether high-uncertainty predictions correspond to cases where the model is more often wrong. Ideally, the model knows when it *doesn’t know* – for example, a completely novel scaffold or a compound with conflicting feature signals might result in a less confident prediction. We can quantify this by reliability diagrams or by checking if filtering out the top 10% most-uncertain predictions improves the precision on the remaining cases. This kind of **selective regression** ensures the model can flag compounds for which a manual review or further testing is warranted.

**Ablation Studies:** To justify each component, we conduct ablation experiments. We train variant models removing one element at a time – e.g. *no transcriptomic features*, *no pretraining*, or *single-task instead of multi-task*. We then report the drop in performance for each task. For instance, removing gene expression inputs might significantly decrease hepatotoxicity AUROC (indicating the importance of those features in capturing mechanisms of liver injury). Or training from scratch (no MolCLR pretrain) might require more data to reach the same performance. Such studies strengthen the claim that **each aspect of the framework (MTL, multi-modal input, pretraining, interpretability) adds value**. Recent studies have shown that including multi-modal features and multitask learning yields superior predictive capability and robustness ([Multimodal Representation Learning via Graph Isomorphism Network for Toxicity Multitask Learning - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39432821/#:~:text=we%20constructed%20a%20novel%20data,superior%20predictive%20capability%20and%20robustness)), which our results would echo.

**Statistical Significance and Validation:** We apply appropriate statistical tests to ensure improvements are significant (e.g. DeLong’s test for AUCs). Cross-validation is used where data is limited, and we might even perform an external validation on an entirely external dataset (for example, evaluate the model on a set of pharmaceutical compounds with known tox from literature or a drug toxicity benchmark). Success is defined not just by metrics, but by the model’s ability to consistently identify toxic compounds *without* over-predicting too many non-toxics (to maintain usefulness in screening). In summary, the evaluation demonstrates a robust, generalizable predictor: high discriminative power (AUROC/PR), reliable probabilities (calibration), outperforming simpler models, and maintaining performance on new data with quantifiable uncertainty.

# Impact & Translational Relevance

**Advancing AI-Driven Drug Safety:** This framework directly enhances early-stage drug development by providing a computational safety screening tool. Traditionally, evaluating cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity requires separate assays (hERG channel tests for cardiotoxicity, liver microsome assays, etc.) and often comes late in the pipeline. Our multi-task model offers an *in silico* “toxicity triad” assessment in one step, flagging risky compounds before significant resources are invested. This can significantly reduce late-stage failures: by identifying a potentially hepatotoxic candidate early, chemists can either drop it or modify its structure. The model’s interpretability is key for actionable insight – for instance, if it highlights a metabolic activation pathway leading to toxicity, chemists might design out the liable functional group. In essence, the framework helps **de-risk compounds earlier**, focusing experimental efforts on safer candidates and thus cutting cost and time ([Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36966203/#:~:text=Explainable%20machine%20learning%20for%20molecular,under%20the%20Receiver%20Operator%20Characteristic)) ([Accurate clinical toxicity prediction using multi-task deep neural nets and contrastive molecular explanations - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36966203/#:~:text=Morgan%20fingerprints%20and%20pre,model%20and%20transfer%20learning%2C%20we)). It also contributes to the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, refinement of animal testing) by reducing reliance on animal toxicity studies, since a reliable model can screen out the worst offenders beforehand.

**Mechanistic Insights & Hypothesis Generation:** Unlike black-box QSAR models, our interpretable MTL approach can generate hypotheses about toxicity mechanisms. For example, it might reveal that compounds triggering a certain gene expression signature (e.g. unfolded protein response) tend to be neurotoxic, suggesting a mechanistic link to neurodegeneration. In the case of EGFR inhibitors, the model could consistently point to immune-inflammatory pathways (like IL-6/STAT3 activation in tissues) as a predictor of multi-organ toxicity. This aligns with clinical observations that EGFR inhibitors cause dermatologic and other side effects via immune modulation ([Frontiers | Mechanism of Lethal Skin Toxicities Induced by Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors and Related Treatment Strategies](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.804212/full#:~:text=leading%20to%20destruction%20of%20immune,%28113%29%20induced%20a)), giving researchers confidence that the model is learning meaningful biology. Such insights could guide *biomarker development* – e.g. if the model identifies gene X’s induction as a red flag for hepatotoxicity, that gene could be measured in preclinical studies as a biomarker. Moreover, multi-task relationships learned by the model might uncover, say, that cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity share a common substructure alert (perhaps indicating a shared off-target interaction); this knowledge could prompt focused studies on that liability. By spotlighting pathway-level effects, the framework bridges chemistry and systems biology, helping toxicologists understand *why* a drug might harm an organ, not just that it could.

**Regulatory Considerations:** For an AI model to impact drug safety in practice, it must align with regulatory science expectations. Agencies like the FDA and EMA are increasingly open to evidence from **in silico** models, especially if they are interpretable and thoroughly validated. Our framework is developed in line with the FDA’s recommended best practices for AI in medicine (transparency, validation, risk assessment). The interpretability (via SHAP, attention, etc.) provides a *rationale* for each prediction, which is crucial for regulatory trust – regulators can be shown the substructures and pathways the model associates with risk, allowing them to assess plausibility. We also adhere to OECD principles for (Q)SAR models by documenting the defined endpoint, algorithm methodology, applicability domain, and appropriate measures of goodness-of-fit, robustness, and predictivity. The multi-task model can be packaged with a report on its domain of applicability: for instance, it may be most reliable for small-molecule drugs within certain chemical space (e.g. drug-like molecules, as that’s what it was trained on). For any compound falling outside this domain, the model can indicate lower confidence, aligning with regulatory caution. Ultimately, while an AI framework won’t replace required toxicology tests in the near term, it can be used to support **regulatory submissions** by contributing evidence in risk assessment. For example, in Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, sponsors might include computational toxicity predictions – a positive prediction might trigger additional investigations, whereas a clean profile might support waivers for certain tests, if justified. Close collaboration with regulatory scientists will be needed to establish appropriate acceptance criteria, but our model is built to facilitate that dialogue by being as interpretable and validated as possible.

**Personalized Toxicity Assessment:** A forward-looking application of this framework is in *personalized medicine*. Patients can have different susceptibility to drug toxicities due to genetic and environmental factors. Our model’s design can incorporate **patient-derived transcriptomic profiles** to potentially predict idiosyncratic toxicity risk. For example, consider using a patient’s liver organoid or induced pluripotent stem cell–derived hepatocyte gene expression response after exposure to a candidate drug – feeding that personalized transcriptomic feature into the model might better predict if that patient (with their unique genetic expression background) would experience liver injury. Similarly, patient-specific gene expression (or even baseline gene expression without drug, indicating predispositions like inflammation levels) could modulate predictions. While this is currently hypothetical, the architecture is compatible with such inputs, and it could become a tool for personalized drug safety in the clinic (e.g. choosing a cancer therapy less likely to cause heart damage in a patient with pre-existing cardiac risk). Additionally, the model could be used to analyze adverse event data from specific subpopulations – effectively learning separate tasks for, say, toxicity in patients with a certain mutation. This flexibility underscores the framework’s broad impact: it’s not just a static model, but an extensible platform for **predictive toxicology** that can evolve with incoming data and be tailored to particular contexts.

In summary, the proposed methodological AI framework represents an innovative and practical advance in drug safety assessment. By combining cutting-edge **multi-task deep learning**, **self-supervised chemical representations**, and **transcriptomics-driven interpretability**, it addresses the complex problem of multi-organ toxicity with improved accuracy and clarity. The framework is robust (leveraging diverse data and shared learning to avoid overfitting), and its insights are biologically meaningful (highlighting pathways like immune responses implicated in toxicity). Such a model can be a game-changer in pharmaceutical R&D – enabling safer drugs to reach patients faster by identifying and explaining toxicity risks early on. The convergence of cheminformatics and bioinformatics in this MTL approach exemplifies the translational power of AI in chemistry and medicine, aligning well with the innovative, interdisciplinary focus of *Nature Machine Intelligence*.
